    - title: Pseduo Live-Studio Audience
      year: 2022
      description: Using a few python libraries I constructed system that used facial recognition to deliver a live studio audience.
        - Developed and implemented a real-time live studio audience, using facial recognition technology.
        - Integrated facial recognition algorithms with a database of recognized faces to trigger predefined sound bites upon detection within the frame.
        - Utilized Python and OpenCV for facial recognition and a package called playsound for sound bite playback.
        - I was very satisfied with the foundational level that this project came out to. It works as expected and I can see many features being added to it. Features like an update database of frequently seen faces, in order to keep a solid grasp on specified individuals changing faces. As well as possibly a mobile app or an API backend that users can use to manage sound bites and add people to the database.
